# Agricultural Commodity Price Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes agricultural commodity prices across states and markets
to identify price differences and market volatility using an end-to-end
data analytics workflow.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Excel (Data exploration)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI (Dashboard & Visualization)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains agricultural market prices including:
- State, Market, Commodity
- Minimum, Maximum, and Modal Prices
- Arrival Date

Note: The dataset represents a single-day market snapshot, so analysis focuses
on cross-sectional insights rather than time-based trends.

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & ETL (Python)
- Cleaned column names and corrected data types
- Validated price logic (Min ≤ Modal ≤ Max)
- Created derived metrics:
  - Average Price
  - Price Range
  - Volatility Classification
- Exported clean datasets for Power BI

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard consists of four pages:
1. Overview & Business Context
2. Summary KPIs
3. Price Comparison Analysis
4. Market & Volatility Analysis

Key insights include:
- Expensive commodities and markets
- State-wise price variation
- High volatility markets

## 📁 Repository Structure

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow from data
cleaning to business insight generation using Python and Power BI.
